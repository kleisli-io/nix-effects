## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **Soundness: refined type composition** — `refine`/`refined` exposed `_kernel` without marking themselves approximate, allowing `Maybe`/`Either` to bypass refinement predicates via the weaker kernel. `Maybe (refined "Nat" Int (x: x >= 0)).check (-1)` returned `true`. Fixed via Galois connection model: `_kernelExact` separates kernel availability from sufficiency, dual-mode conjunction/replacement semantics in `mkType`
- **`elaborate.decide` totality for records** — `elaborateValue` record case did raw `v.${field}` access without checking field presence. Missing-attribute errors are uncatchable by `builtins.tryEval`, making `decide` crash instead of returning `false`. Fixed with safe `fieldOf` helper

### Added

- `_kernelExact` field on all types — `true` when the kernel alone is sufficient for correct checking (no guard residual needed)
- `Record` per-field blame tracking via custom `verify` — delegates to each field type's `.validate` for recursive decomposition (context: `Record{age, name}.age`)
- `Variant` per-branch blame tracking via custom `verify` — delegates to active branch's `.validate`
- Composition soundness tests: deep composition, kernel-exact propagation, chained refinements, adequacy property

### Changed

- Type constructors (`Record`, `ListOf`, `Maybe`, `Either`, `Variant`) use `_kernelExact` instead of `? _kernel` for guard decisions and set explicit `approximate` flags
- `_kernel` is now always exposed on all types as the best kernel approximation; `kernelCheck` and `prove` remain gated on `!isApproximate`
- `Pi` without explicit `kernelType` omits redundant `isFunction` guard (conjunction with `kernelDecide` handles it)
- Locked nixpkgs via `nixpkgs.nix` for deterministic non-flake builds (@vic, kleisli-io/nix-effects#9)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- `Justfile`: `just test` now accepts an optional suite argument (`just test <suite>`) to selectively run a single test suite instead of all tests (kleisli-io/nix-effects#11, contributed by @vic)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- `comp.nix`: Computation ADT module — single source of truth for `Pure`/`Impure` construction and elimination via `pure`, `impure`, `isPure`, and `match`. All modules now use these constructors instead of raw `_tag` attrset literals (closes #7)
- `kernel.pipe`: chain a computation through Kleisli arrows, threading results via bind (closes #6)
- `kernel.kleisli`: Kleisli composition `(a -> M b) -> (b -> M c) -> (a -> M c)`
- `queue.identity`: sentinel variant representing the identity continuation, letting the trampoline skip queue application for bare `send` effects
- Benchmark infrastructure: `nix run .#bench` / `nix run .#bench-compare` with named history, 3-run median, and comparison tables
- Benchmark apps: expression interpreter (`apps/interp`) and dependency graph evaluator (`apps/build-sim`) with scalable workload generators
- Benchmark stress tests: effectHeavy, bindHeavy, mixed, rawGC microbenchmarks for diagnosing bottlenecks
- Per-module test result reporting in `tests` output

### Changed

- Trampoline interpreter processes continuation queues inline via recursive `applyQueue` (depth-limited to 500, with genericClosure fallback for deep pure chains), keeping 1 genericClosure step per effect — 78% faster on effectHeavy 100k, 72% faster on mixed 100k vs 0.4.0
- `send` uses Identity queue instead of `singleton pure`, eliminating one wasted identity continuation application per effect
- `queue.viewlGo` fast-path: returns immediately when left child is already a Leaf, skipping genericClosure entry for the common case
- `queue.snoc` and `queue.append` handle Identity variant transparently
- All source modules migrated from raw `{ _tag = "Pure"; ... }` / `{ _tag = "Impure"; ... }` literals to `comp.pure` / `comp.impure` constructors, and from `._tag == "Pure"` checks to `comp.isPure`
- README and book reframed around the effect layer as the primary abstraction; removed Fire Triangle framing
- Book: trampoline guide updated to use `isPure`

### Fixed

- `build.materialize`: step-script env test matched exact quoting instead of presence

### Removed

- `examples/typed-derivation.nix` and the proof-gated derivation showcase wired through it. The example was contrived (the same policy is expressible with `assert`) and did not reflect how the library is actually used. The `api-server` package output and the book's "Proof-gated derivations" section in the Proof Guide are removed along with it. The `v.verify` verified-extraction pipeline it demonstrated is still available and documented in the remaining `examples/` and in the Proof Guide.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-06

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `mk`-wrapped functions are now directly callable, removing the need for `.value` (@vic, #1)
- Test extraction produces nested attrsets instead of flat dotted keys, enabling targeted `nix-unit` runs (@vic, #5)

### Added

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` explaining the josh mirror workflow
- `shell.nix`, `Justfile`, `tests.nix` for non-flake dev workflow (@vic, #4)

### Removed

- Unused flake inputs (@vic, #3)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Effects-powered build module (`fx.build`): typed build steps, eval-time validation, and derivation materialization
- `fx.build.BuildStep` and `fx.build.BuildPlan` Record types for describing build pipelines
- `fx.build.plan`: eval-time validation pipeline that type-checks steps and filters conditional steps via `when` predicates, collecting all errors without throwing
- `fx.build.materialize`: converts a validated BuildPlan + pkgs into a `pkgs.runCommand` derivation with per-step env isolation, source copying, and shell generation

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Typed pipeline framework (`fx.pipeline`): composable stages with `mkStage`, `compose`, and `run`, wiring reader, error, acc, and typecheck effects with typed boundaries between stages
- Pipeline convenience re-exports: `ask`, `asks`, `raise`, `raiseWith`, `warn`, `pure`, `bind`, `map` for use inside stage transforms
- 14 inline tests and 2 integration tests for the pipeline module
